FORKING IT DOWN
My New Control

DESCRIPTION
During security assessment, it has been observed that the OTPs generated by the application are insufficiently random. 

Impact
The usage of insecure random number generation would lead to the generation of insufficiently random OTPs. This would allow an attacker to predict the OTPs which may lead to fraudulent transactions, authentication bypass, etc.

Recommendations
"It is recommended that the application should generate sufficiently random OTPs using a cryptographically secure random number generator. It is also recommended that the application should implement the following best practices while implementing OTP based authentication:

1. Detect and block OTP brute force attempts.
2. The application should also disallow OTP reuse such that the OTP which is used once should be discarded from the server memory and must be treated as invalid if replayed by the user. 
3. The OTP expiry should be implemented such that after a certain threshold, the OTP code should expire and discarded from the server memory.
"
